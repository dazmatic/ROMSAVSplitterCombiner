# GameBoy ROMSAVSplitterCombiner
A small 'vibe coded' python executable that allows for the combining and or splitting of 4 or 3 rom files and their subsequent saves for use on a ChisFlash EPM240 CPLD based flashcart with 8mb rom and 128kb SRAM

I believe the menus are derivatives of NekoCart so thanks to Zephray for their work.
